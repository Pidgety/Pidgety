Hi, I'm Philip.

I'm currently working towards getting my first role as a software engineer 
or developer, transferring from a career in education management.  I've always 
enjoyed problem-solving and find myself fully absorbed by the challenges 
involved in programming.

I have recently finished a 16-week Software Engineering bootcamp, with a focus on
Python, and my repositories include some of the projects I completed as
part of this.


### Current project

I am developing a program to assist users in learning and practising piano 
scales and argeggios. It will include a spaced repetition feature and, 
as my knowledge improves, I plan to add a GUI and potentially make use of AI
in guiding a user's practice.


### Current learning

In addition to the bootcamp, I am in the process of:

* deepening my knowledge of Python by creating more complex projects, taking
  additional Udemy courses, reading books on Python and participating in
  HackerRank and Exercism challenges.

* addressing gaps in my Computer Science knowledge by taking Udemy courses
  on data structures and algorithms, and reading Hands On Data Structures
  and Algorithms with Python (Argawal, 2018, Packt).

* broadening my awareness of other languages, systems and frameworks by taking
  Udemy courses on:

  * HTML, CSS & JavaScript (in progress)
  * Django (in progress)
  * Git and GitHub (completed)
  * MySQL (completed)

Please see personal_development.md for further details.
